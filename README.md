rticonnextdds-connector: Node.js/JavaScript
=======

(return to [rticonnextdds-connector](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector))

### RTI Connector for Connext DDS
*RTI Connector* for Connext DDS is a quick and easy way to access the power and
functionality of [RTI Connext DDS](http://www.rti.com/products/index.html).
It is based on [XML Application Creation](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/xml_application_creation/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_XML_AppCreation_GettingStarted.pdf) and Dynamic Data.

____
**Warning**: The Node.js/JavaScript *Connector* uses 0-based indexing for sequences since
v0.4.0. Previously sequences started at index 1. See *read/take data* more more
information.

### Dependencies

#### Node.js packages:
 The Node.js/JavaScript *Connector* has the following dependencies, which are also listed in package.json:
* [ref](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ref): turns Buffer instances into "pointers"
* [util](https://www.npmjs.com/package/util): used for 'inherits' and for formatting strings
* [ffi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi): used for loading and calling dynamic libraries using pure JavaScript
* [events](): used for the 'EventEmitter'

There are also some dependencies for the examples:
* [sleep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sleep): to sleep x amount of seconds
* [socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io): for an example of integration between DDS and a web browser

#### node-gyp and python
Some of the dependencies are not pure JavaScript and are shipped as source code. They use [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) to compile. node-gpy requires python 2.7; it does not work with python 3.x.x. Please check the requirement for node-gpy at the following links:
* [unix](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-unix)
* [dawin](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-macos)
* [windows](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows)

#### C/C++ compiler
Some of the *Connector* dependencies, such as [ref](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ref), are distributed in source code and they depend on [nan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nan) (Native Abstractions for Node.js). If you are using a modern version of Node.js, have a modern C++ compiler on your machine (C++11).

*Connector* may work with older versions of OS/Compiler/Node if you are able to get all the dependencies compiled.

### Language Support
This repository is specific to Node.js/JavaScript. For other languages (python, lua, C, etc.), refer to the [main *Connector* repository](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector).

We use [libffi](https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi) to call our library; these details are hidden in a JavaScript wrapper. RTI tested its Node.js/JavaScript implementation with node v8.7.0; it should also work with lower versions.

### Platform support
Node.js/JavaScript *Connector* builds its library for [select architectures](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector/tree/master/lib).
__Be sure to read the dependencies section above.__
If you need another architecture, please contact your RTI account manager or sales@rti.com.

**Windows Note**: RTI tested the Node.js/JavaScript *Connector* on WindowsÂ® 10 64-bit. Those tests showed that npm works best with Visual Studio Express 2013.
Feel free to ask questions on the [RTI Community forum](https://community.rti.com/forums/technical-questions) for more details on Windows and *Connector*.

To check the version of the libraries, run the following command. For example:

### Testing
We tested on:
* For MacOS 64 bit : Darwin 18  clang 10
* For Windows 64 bit: Windows 10 64 bit VS2015
* For Windows 32 bit: Windows 7 32 bit VS2017
* For Linux 64 bit: CentOS 6.5 gcc 4.8.2
* For Linux 32 bit: Ubuntu 16.04 gcc 5.4.0
* For ARM: Yocto linux 2.0.3 gcc 5.2.0

### Version of Connext
``` bash
strings librtiddsconnector.dylib | grep BUILD
```

### Threading model
The *Connector* Native API does not yet implement any mechanism for thread safety. For now, you are responsible for protecting calls to *Connector*. (In future, thread safety may be added in the native layer.)
In Node.js/JavaScript, threading should not be a problem due to the 'callback' style of the language.

### Support
*Connector* is an experimental RTI product. If you have questions, use the [RTI Community forum](https://community.rti.com/forums/technical-questions).

### Getting started with Node.js
Be sure you have all the tools to work with Node.js. Then invoke:

``` bash
$ npm install rticonnextdds-connector
```

When the installation is complete, cd into the node_modules directory.


### Available examples
You can find several sets of examples in the [examples/nodejs](examples/nodejs) directory.  If you used npm to install, you will need to clone the this repository to access the examples.

 * **simple**: shows how to write samples, how to read/take, and how to use event-based reading.
 * **transform**: shows how to write a simple transformation using *Connector*. This is also a good place to understand how to use the setFromJSON and getJSON APIs to interact with samples and instances.
 * **web_http**: shows how an HTTP client can request DDS data using REST.
 * **web_socket**: shows how to push DDS data to a browser through [socket.io](https://github.com/Automattic/socket.io).

### API overview
#### require the *Connector* library
To use `rticonnextdds-connector`, require it as follows:

```js
const rti = require('rticonnextdds-connector');
```

#### instantiate a new *Connector*
To create a new *Connector*, pass an XML file and a configuration name:    

```js
const connector = new rti.Connector("MyParticipantLibrary::Zero","./ShapeExample.xml");
```
For more information on
the XML format, see the [XML-Based Application Creation Getting Started Guide](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/xml_application_creation/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_XML_AppCreation_GettingStarted.pdf) or
look at the [ShapeExample.xml](examples/nodejs/ShapeExample.xml) file included in the examples directory.

#### delete a *Connector*
To destroy all the DDS entities that belong to a *Connector* previously created, call the ```delete``` function:

```js
const connector = new rti.Connector("MyParticipantLibrary::Zero","./ShapeExample.xml");
...
...
connector.delete();
```

#### write a sample
To write a sample, first get a reference to the output port:

```js
const output = connector.getOutput("MyPublisher::MySquareWriter");
```

Then set the instance's fields:

```js
output.instance.setNumber("x",1);
output.instance.setNumber("y",2);
output.instance.setNumber("shapesize",30);
output.instance.setString("color", "BLUE");
```

Then write:

```js
output.write();
```

#### set the instance's fields:
The content of an instance can be set in two ways:

 * **Field by field**:

```js
output.instance.setNumber("y",2);
```

The following APIs set an instance field by field: `setNumber(fieldName, number);` `setBoolean(fieldName, boolean);` and `setString(fieldName, string);`.

Nested fields can be accessed with the dot notation `"x.y.z"`. Arrays or sequences can be accessed with square brackets: `"x.y[1].z"`. For more information on how to access
fields, see the "Data Access API" section of the
[RTI Prototyper Getting Started Guide](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/prototyper/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_Prototyper_GettingStarted.pdf).


 * **Passing a JSON object**:

```js
output.setFromJSON(jsonObj)
```


#### read/take data
To read/take samples, first get a reference to the input port:

```js
const input = connector.getInput("MySubscriber::MySquareReader");
```

Then call the `read()` or `take()` API:

```js
input.read();
```

 or

```js
input.take();
```

The read/take operation can return multiple samples. Therefore, you must iterate on an array:

```js
for (i=0; i <= input.samples.getLength(); i++) {
  if (input.infos.isValid(i)) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(input.samples.getJSON(i)));
  }
}
```

#### access sample fields after a read/take
A `read()` or `take()` operation can return multiple samples. They are stored in an array.

We can access the samples in two ways:

 * **Field by field**:

 ```js
 for (i=0; i <= input.samples.getLength(); i++) {
   if (input.infos.isValid(i)) {
     console.log(input.samples.getNumber(i, "x"));
   }
 }
 ```

 The following APIs access the samples field by field: `getNumber(indexm fieldName);` `getBoolean(index, fieldName);` and `getString(index, fieldName);`.

 * **As a JSON object**:

 ```js
 for (i=0; i <= input.samples.getLength(); i++) {
   if (input.infos.isValid(i)) {
     console.log(JSON.stringify(input.samples.getJSON(i)));
   }
 }
 ```

#### event-based reading

 If you don't want to do polling, ask *Connector* to notify you when data is available:

 ```js
 connector.on('on_data_available',
   function() {
     input.take();
     for (i=0; i <= input.samples.getLength(); i++) {
         if (input.infos.isValid(i)) {
             console.log(JSON.stringify(input.samples.getJSON(i)));
         }
     }

});
```

Notice that if you have multiple inputs, you will have to check all of them.
